           <h2>Richelle Williams</h2>
           <p>My major is Software Engineering. I am an only child.
            I like art, graphic design and music. I like pastel colours,
            mainly pink. I am interested in Web Development because I want
            to improve my knowledge of HTML and CSS from COMP1220 as well as
            learn new ways of developing websites and how to make them appealing
            to the eye. I also want to learn more about GitHub as I often see it
            online but don't quite understand its use, and to apply the web development
            skills learnt from this course in future courses and life.</p>
